# Idaho Weird Schemas

The schema they use on their older exports are so bizare that I might just as well put it here.

All of this data comes from their legacy system, so only from 1994 until 2018. From 1994 until 2000 the data are available every 2 years, then there’s suddenly the year 2001 after 2000. After 2001, it jumps to 2004, then from then on it’s back to 2 years step of data avilabbitly.
